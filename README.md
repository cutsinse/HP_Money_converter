# HP_Money_converter
convert USD to Harry Potter money

This program was created as I was/am working through "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way." by Zed A. Shaw. 
- Original strategy(created after exercise 21 in the book):  
  - two separate files: one to convert HP money to USD, and a different file to convert USD to HP money
  - uses functions and the int(input()) and float(input()) framework to get a string from the user and convert it into numbers python can work with
  - changes USD to knuts, which are then divided out to give the amount of Galleons, sickles, and remaining knuts.  Other file goes the opposite way.
- Second version (hp_if.py)
  - takes the contents of 21b and 21c and merges them, using user input and the newly learned if statement to allow the user to choose what to do.
